# Spec Map

Quick-reference guide for AI agents to locate the right spec file.
Spec files are source of truth.

## Layout

```text
decisions/   Architectural decision records (DR-NNN)
iterations/  Iteration records (IR-NNN)
dev/         Implementation requirements
user/        User-facing behavior
test/        Verification criteria
```

Specs use GEARS syntax ([META-001](user/meta.md#meta-001)).
Authoring rules: [dev/style.md](dev/style.md).

## Decisions

| ID | File | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DR-000 | [000-initial-specs-structure.md](decisions/000-initial-specs-structure.md) | Specs directory layout, GEARS syntax, naming conventions |
| DR-001 | [001-unified-cli-agent-interface-architecture.md](decisions/001-unified-cli-agent-interface-architecture.md) | TypeScript library with async generator interface across CLI agents |
| DR-002 | [002-unified-event-stream-and-adapter-interface.md](decisions/002-unified-event-stream-and-adapter-interface.md) | Unified Event Stream, driver-adapter contract, permission model |

## Iterations

| ID | File | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IR-000 | [000-spdx-headers.md](iterations/000-spdx-headers.md) | Add SPDX headers to applicable files |
